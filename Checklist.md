# Home Office Ergonomics Self-Assessment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your home office setup supports neutral postures and reduces the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.

## Chair and Posture

- [ ] Chair height allows feet to be flat on the floor or supported by a footrest.
- [ ] Knees are at about the same height as hips, forming a 90° angle.
- [ ] Lower back (lumbar) is supported by the chair or a lumbar cushion.
- [ ] Shoulders are relaxed, not hunched or rounded forward.
- [ ] Upper arms hang naturally at sides, elbows bent between 90° and 120°.
- [ ] Thighs are parallel to the floor, with even pressure along the seat.

## Desk and Keyboard/Mouse

- [ ] Desk height allows forearms to be parallel to the floor when typing.
- [ ] Keyboard is positioned so wrists are straight, not bent up or down.
- [ ] Mouse is placed close to the keyboard, at the same height.
- [ ] Wrists are not resting on hard edges; a padded wrist rest is used if needed.
- [ ] Keyboard and mouse are within easy reach without stretching.

## Monitor and Screen Position

- [ ] Top of the monitor is at or slightly below eye level.
- [ ] Monitor is about an arm's length away (approximately 20-30 inches).
- [ ] Screen is directly in front of you, not angled to the side.
- [ ] Monitor brightness and contrast are adjusted to comfortable levels.
- [ ] No glare or reflections on the screen; window blinds or task lighting are used to control light.

## Work Environment (Lighting, Noise, etc.)

- [ ] Ambient lighting is sufficient without causing screen glare.
- [ ] Task lighting is available for reading documents.
- [ ] Noise levels are manageable; headphones or noise-canceling devices are used if needed.
- [ ] Room temperature is comfortable, with adequate ventilation.
- [ ] Cables are organized to avoid tripping hazards and maintain a clear workspace.

## Work Habits (Breaks, Movement, Posture Changes)

- [ ] Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
- [ ] Take regular short breaks (5 minutes every hour) to stand, stretch, or walk.
- [ ] Alternate between sitting and standing if a standing desk is available.
- [ ] Avoid prolonged static postures; change position at least every 2 hours.
- [ ] Use a timer or app to remind you to take breaks and move.
